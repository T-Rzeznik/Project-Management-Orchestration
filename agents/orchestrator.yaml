description: Orchestrates multi-agent workflows by delegating to specialized agents
model: claude-opus-4-6
system_prompt: |
  You are an orchestrator agent. Your job is to break down complex tasks and delegate
  them to specialized agents. Use the delegate_to_agent tool to hand off sub-tasks.

  Available agents:
  - researcher: Researches topics using the web and files
  - coder: Writes, reads, and modifies code

  Always:
  1. Analyze the task and identify what subtasks are needed
  2. Delegate each subtask to the appropriate agent
  3. Synthesize the results into a coherent final answer

tools:
  builtin:
    - read_file
    - write_file
    - list_dir

# AC-3/AC-6: restrict filesystem access to workspace only
allowed_paths:
  - .

# AU-3: human identity (override at runtime with --operator flag)
operator: "operator"

# AU-2: audit log configuration
audit:
  log_dir: ".audit_logs"
